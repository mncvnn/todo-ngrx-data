# todo-ngrx-data
For demonstration @ngrx/data, apply for Todo App.

## Note

### Using @ngrx/data, which need:

- [x] @ngrx/store
- [x] @ngrx/effects
- [x] @ngrx/entity (AND)
- [x] @angular/common/http

### Caution

- The API must be well defined, have to follow RESTFUL and clear defined for plural and single entity.
- If NOT, have to customize the actions and affect.

> The original way is more complicated but also more flexible to control the code and flow.
